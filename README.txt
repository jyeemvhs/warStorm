GAME INFO


Medium M4 “Sherman” Tank
Specifications
Main Armament: 75mm canon
Armor: 64-76mm cast steel hull
Weight: 33 tons
Engine: R975 gasoline engine
Top Speed: 35 mph

The M4 Sherman was the main battle tank used by US forces in WWII. Efficient and cheap to build,
the United States built thousands of these tanks during the war. There were no shortcuts in design,
however, as these tanks dominated the battlefields throughout the western fronts.
Though lacking in pure firepower and armor, the Sherman held its own with speed, agility,
and strength in numbers.

Panzerkampfwagen VI “Tiger” Ausf. E
Specifications
Main Armament: 88mm canon
Armor: 75-100mm interlocking welded steel hull
Weight: 54 tons
Engine: 12 twin-cylinder HL210 petrol engine
Top Speed: 23 mph

The German-made Tiger was a monster on WWII battlefields. It boasted a punishing main gun and
near-impervious armor; which gave it an upper hand in direct firefights against other smaller
and lighter tanks. Sherman tank commanders feared the Tiger, as the main gun of the Sherman would
barely pierce the Tiger’s 10 centimeter armor plates.

The Tiger’s main strengths were its weaknesses as well. The Germans underestimated the challenges
of designing and building an engine that could move the 50-ton beast. As a result, the Tiger was slow
and lumberous, and very few were built over the course of the war. The Sherman tanks could outnumber
and overwhelm the Tigers with their superior speed and mobility.
